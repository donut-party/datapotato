## Purpose

Datapotato lets you write test fixtures that are clear, concise, and easy to
maintain. It's great for dramatically reducing test boilerplate.

Say you want to test a scenario where a forum post has gotten three likes by
three different users. You'd first have to create a hierarchy of records for the
post, topic, topic category, and users. You have to make sure that all the
foreign keys are correct (e.g. the post's `:topic-id` is set to the topic's
`:id`) and that everything is inserted in the right order.

With Datapotato, all you have to do is **write code like this**:

```clojure
(insert {:like [{:count 3}]})
```

and **these records get inserted** in a database (in the order displayed):

```clojure
[[:user {:id 1 :username "T2TD3pAB79X5"}]
 [:user {:id 2 :username "ziJ9GnvNMOHcaUz"}]
 [:topic-category {:id 3 :created-by-id 2 :updated-by-id 2}]
 [:topic {:id 6
          :topic-category-id 3
          :title "4juV71q9Ih9eE1"
          :created-by-id 2
          :updated-by-id 2}]
 [:post {:id 10 :topic-id 6 :created-by-id 2 :updated-by-id 2}]
 [:like {:id 14 :post-id 10 :created-by-id 1}]
 [:like {:id 17 :post-id 10 :created-by-id 2}]
 [:user {:id 20 :username "b73Ts5BoO"}]
 [:like {:id 21 :post-id 10 :created-by-id 20}]]
```

If you like tools that help you write code that's **clear**, **concise**, and
**easy to maintain**, then [check out the
tutorial](https://sweet-tooth.gitbook.io/datapotato/tutorial) and learn how to
use Datapotato :)

## Short Sweet Example

If you're more of a _gimme fun now_ kind of person, then try out this
little interactive example. First, clone Datapotato:

```
git clone https://github.com/donut-power/datapotato.git
```

Open `examples/short-sweet/short_sweet.clj` in your favorite editor
and start a REPL. I've also included the code below in case for
example you don't have access to a REPL because, say, you're in some
kind of Taken situation and you only have access to a phone and you're
using your precious battery life to go through this README.

The first ~66 lines of code include all the setup necessary for the
examples to run, followed by snippets to try out with example
output. Definitely play with the snippets 😀 Can you generate multiple
todos or todo lists?

``` clojure
(ns short-sweet
  (:require
   [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]
   [clojure.spec.gen.alpha :as gen]
   [donut.datapotato.core :as dc]))

;;-------*****--------
;; Begin example setup
;;-------*****--------

;; ---
;; Define specs for our domain entities

;; The ::id should be a positive int, and to generate it we increment
;; the number stored in `id-seq`. This ensures unique ids and produces
;; values that are easier for humans to understand
(def id-seq (atom 0))
(s/def ::id (s/with-gen pos-int? #(gen/fmap (fn [_] (swap! id-seq inc)) (gen/return nil))))
(s/def ::not-empty-string (s/and string? not-empty #(< (count %) 10)))

(s/def ::username ::not-empty-string)
(s/def ::user (s/keys :req-un [::id ::username]))

(s/def ::created-by-id ::id)
(s/def ::content ::not-empty-string)
(s/def ::post (s/keys :req-un [::id ::created-by-id ::content]))

(s/def ::post-id ::id)
(s/def ::like (s/keys :req-un [::id ::post-id ::created-by-id]))

;; ---
;; The schema defines datapotato `ent-types`, which roughly
;; correspond to db tables. It also defines the `:spec` for generting
;; ents of that type, and defines ent `relations` that specify how
;; ents reference each other
(def schema
  {:user {:prefix   :u
          :generate {:schema ::user}}
   :post {:prefix    :p
          :generate  {:schema ::post}
          :relations {:created-by-id [:user :id]}}
   :like {:prefix      :l
          :generate    {:schema ::like}
          :relations   {:post-id       [:post :id]
                        :created-by-id [:user :id]}
          :constraints {:created-by-id #{:uniq}}}})

;; Our "db" is a vector of inserted records we can use to show that
;; entities are inserted in the correct order
(def mock-db (atom []))

(defn insert-in-atom
  "Simulates inserting records in a db by conjing values onto an atom. ent-type is
  `:user`, `:post`, or `:like`, corresponding to the keys in the schema.
  `visit-val` is the map generated by clojure.spec"
  [_ent-db {:keys [ent-type visit-val]}]
  (swap! mock-db conj [ent-type visit-val]))

(def insert-visiting-fn
  (dc/wrap-incremental-insert-visiting-fn :generate insert-in-atom))

(def ent-db
  {:schema   schema
   :generate {:generator (comp gen/generate s/gen)}})

(defn insert
  [query]
  (reset! id-seq 0)
  (reset! mock-db [])
  (-> ent-db
      (dc/generate query)
      (dc/visit-ents-once :inserted-data insert-visiting-fn))
  ;; normally you'd return the expression above, but return nil for
  ;; the example to not produce overwhelming output
  nil)

;;-------*****--------
;; Begin snippets to try in REPL
;;-------*****--------

;; Return a map of user entities and their spec-generated data
(dc/generate-attr-map ent-db {:user [{:count 3}]})

;; You can specify a username and id
(dc/generate-attr-map ent-db {:user [{:count      1
                                      :generate {:username "Meeghan"
                                                 :id       100}}]})

;; Generating a post generates the user the post belongs to, with
;; foreign keys correct
(dc/generate-attr-map ent-db {:post [{:count 1}]})

;; Generating a like also generates a post and user
(dc/generate-attr-map ent-db {:like [{:count 1}]})

;; The `insert` function shows that records are inserted into the
;; simulate "database" (`mock-db`) in correct dependency order:
(insert {:like [{:count 1}]})
@mock-db
```

## Usage

This is meant as a quick reference. If none of the terms below make
sense, [check out the
tutorial](https://sweet-tooth.gitbook.io/datapotato/tutorial).

In Datapotato, you _add ents_ to an _ent db_ using a _schema_ and
_query_. You associate ents with attributes (and perform side effects
like db insertion) using _visiting functions_.

### Schema

A schema is a map of _ent types_ to _ent type schemas_:

```clojure
;; example schema
(def schema
  {:user {:prefix :u}
   :post {:prefix :p}
   :like {:prefix      :l
          :generate    {:schema ::like}
          :relations   {:post-id       [:post :id]
                        :created-by-id [:user :id]}
          :constraints {:created-by-id #{:uniq}}}})
```

* Every ent type schema must have a `:prefix` key. This is used to
  name the ents Datapotato generates.
* `:generate` is used by `donut.datapotato.core/generate` to generate values for
   ents. Its value is a map that includes a `:schema` key, whose value is used
   by a _generator_ (like `clojure.spec.gen.alpha/generate` or
   `malli.generator`)
* `:relations` specify how ents of different types reference each other
* `:constraints` provide additional rules around ent generation and visitation:
  * `:uniq` means that every generated ent must reference a unique ent of the
    given type. In the schema above, multiple `:like`s must each reference a
    distinct `:user`.
  * `:coll` indicates that the given attribute can reference multiple ents. [See
    the
    tutorial](https://sweet-tooth.gitbook.io/datapotato/tutorial/11-collect-constraint-vector-of-foreign-keys)
  * `:required` is used to indicate ent sort order when your ent graph has a cycle

You can also add arbitrary keys to the schema matching the `visit-key`s you give
to visiting functions. The schema will be available to the visiting function
under the key `schema-opts`.

### Queries

You specify ents to add to an _ent db_ using a _query_:

```clojure
(dc/add-ents {:schema schema} {:like [{:count 3}})
```

Above, `{:like [{:count 3}}` is a query meaning "Add 3 likes to the ent db, as
well as the hierarchy of ents necessary for 3 likes to be present."

When you add ents to the ent db, that means that Datapotato has created a graph
node to represent the ent and added it an internal graph that represents all
their ents and their relationships.

### Visiting functions

You can apply a function to each ent's graph node in topologically sorted
(topsort) order and associate the return value as a node attribute.

(Topsort means that if a `:post` references a `:user`, then the `:user` will be
placed before the `:post` in the sort.)

```clojure
(-> (dc/add-ents {:schema good-schema} {:like [{:count 3}})
    (dc/visit-ents :prn (fn [db {:keys [ent-name ent-type]}]
                          (prn [ent-name ent-type]))))
[:u1 :user]
[:p0 :post]
[:l1 :like]
[:u0 :user]
[:l0 :like]
[:u2 :user]
[:l2 :like]
```

In the example above, `dc/visit-ents` is used to apply an anonymous function to
every ent, printing the ent's name and type. The `:prn` key is called the _visit
key_. The return value of the visiting function is associated with each ent node
using the visit key.

The first argument to the visit function is always the entire ent db. The second
argument is a map that includes the following keys:

* `:ent-name`: `:u0`, `:u1` and the like
* `:attrs`: a map of all node attrs for the ent. These attrs are also merged
  into the map passed to the visit function
* `:visit-val` - current value of the visit attr for this node. Could be present
  from previous visits.
* `:visit-key`, the key used to associate the return value of the visit fn with
  the node
* `:query-opts`: any options you might have included in the query used to
  generate this node
* `:visit-query-opts`: just looks up the value of `:visit-key` in the
  `:query-opts` map
* `:schema-opts`: any options set for `:visit-key` in the schema

## TODO

- document `:bind` syntax
- document `wrap-generate-visiting-fn`
